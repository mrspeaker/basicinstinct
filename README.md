# Listings: the game


## notes:

* git messages could be clues
* thinkin' *Sneakers*, but with 85% less Robert Redford and 50% more *Hackers* (but like, legit).
* make things proc gen? and scriptable with ItsBasic
* everything in the world can be controlled with ItsBasic.
  name things?

* goal is not to teach BASIC: player should alwyas be out of their depth, and has no help from anyone else in the gaem. Fumbling always forward and learning stuff the hardest of hard ways.

## Rules engine? how could it work?

class Rule {
  constructor (condition, action) {
    this.condition = condition;
    this.action = action;
  }

  exec () {
    if (this.condition()) this.action();
  }
}

const ifPlayerDead = () => {
  return player.health <= 0;
}
const removePlayerFromWorld = () => {
  world.remove(player);
}

const r = new Rule(ifPlayerDead, removePlayerFromWorld)

r.exec();
